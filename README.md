# BoodschApp

This app was made as an assignment for my University. <br>
It is a basic ToDo list app featuring; drag-n-drop, checkboxes, add/remove tasks and a counter per task.

The project was bootstrapped using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br>
I used the CSS framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io).

Follow these steps to use/preview this app (_make sure to have Git & npm installed_):

- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and npm, which comes with [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Open up a command console, and type in `git clone https://github.com/OneBigOwnage/react-to-do-app.git`.
- In the same window, type `npx serve react-to-do-app\build`.
- Now open Chrome and go to the following URL: localhost:5000
- That's it, you should see the app up and running in the browser.
